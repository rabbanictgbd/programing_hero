<p>hyper-text markup language</p>

<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of <b>HTML</b> pages. With <i>HTML</i> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <strong>HTML</strong> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. <em>HTML</em> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img> and <input> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> and </p> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
